        <h1>Italian Pasta Salad!</h1>
        <p class="dsc">Now that summer is here, the last thing you want to do is spend hours in the hot kitchen making meals for the family. (Of course, you still want to serve your loved ones homemade dishes, but they should be super easy and stress-free.) That's where these summer pasta salads come into play. And who doesn't love pasta salad? Cold pasta salads are the ideal side dish for hot summer months because they're meant to be served chilled. Every plate only takes mere minutes to whip up, so you can spend less time inside cooking dinner and more time enjoying outdoor activities with your kids. If you're planning a backyard barbecue—perhaps for Memorial Day weekend or the 4th of July—these delicious pasta salads deserve a spot on your spread. They go perfectly with grilled meats, and everything will taste even better when you wash it down with a fresh summer cocktail. If you're worried about the boring pasta salad your granny used to make (sorry, Grandma! ), don't worry.</p>

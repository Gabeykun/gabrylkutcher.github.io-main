            <ul>
                <li>Step 1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
                <li>Step 2. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
                <li>Step 3. In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
                <li>Step 4. Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Step 5. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour. </li>
                <li>Step 6. Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li>
                <li>Step 7. Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Step 8. Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Step 9. Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>

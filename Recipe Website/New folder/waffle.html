        <p class="dsc">There's nothing easier than mixing up a batch of homemade waffles. Starting out your morning with a delicious from-scratch breakfast sets the perfect tone for the rest of the day. Even though it’s really easy, we understand that waffle-making can seem like an intimidating process. If you’d like some guidance before you dive in, check out Betty’s How to Make Waffles Guide, which has everything you need to know. It covers how to make your favorite kind of waffles (crispy or fluffy), the difference between waffles and pancake batter and even what to do with leftover waffles. It also suggests different kinds of waffles you might like to try, including Buttermilk Waffles, Bacon Buttermilk Waffles, Whole Wheat Waffles with Honey Peanut Butter Syrup, Cornmeal Waffles, Spicy Cornmeal Waffles, Granola with Double Berry Sauce and Cinnamon-Bun Waffles with Cream Cheese Glaze. You can find even more inspiration in this waffle recipe collection.</p>
